# Mini fair zip file 
Zip files for mini fair 
[V 0.1](https://github.com/AmnestyAM/mini-fair-zip/blob/main/mini-fair-V-0-1.zip)     

Commiting here with "zip-it" in the comment should build a zip file from the [min-fair repo ](https://github.com/fairpm/mini-fair-repo) using this [github workflow](https://github.com/AmnestyAM/mini-fair-zip/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) and action.   
[GitHub pages](https://amnestyam.github.io/mini-fair-zip/) are enaabled, this allows the plugin to be installed and navigate the CORS issues when intalling via github.com.    

# Mini fair playground link 

There is also a [WordPress Play Gound](https://wordpress.org/playground/) that uses this [blue print](https://github.com/amnestyam/mini-fair-zip/blob/main/blueprint.json) that should show the latest zip file we have for the [min-fair repo ](https://github.com/fairpm/mini-fair-repo).   
 
When a new version if release we will save the zip here (while they dont have releases) and update the playgound link for the older versions such as [Verson 0.1](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amnestyam/mini-fair-repo/refs/heads/main/blueprint-v-0-1.json).   

I hope this is helpfull even thought it probably wont work! Maybe someone will come along and fork it! :-)
